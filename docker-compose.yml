# docker-compose.yml

# Purpose:
# - Defines and runs multi-container Docker applications.
# - Includes 'web' service (Django app) and 'db' service (PostgreSQL database).
# - Manages dependencies between services (web depends on db).
# - Maps local ports to container ports.
# - Mounts volumes for code persistence and database data persistence.
# - Supports environment variables via .env file.

# Notes:
# - Makes development and deployment reproducible and isolated.
# - Can be extended with more services like Redis, Celery, Nginx, etc.
# - Recommended for both local development and production setups.
